These are the mathematical symbols used in Python:	
	+ plus
	- minus
	/ slash
	* asterisk
	% percent
	< less-than
	> greater-than
	<= less-than-equal
	>= greater-than-equal

Python will always evaluate the arithmetic operators first:
	(** is highest,
	then multiplication/division,
	then addition/subtraction).
	Next comes the relational operators.
	Finally, the logical operators are done last.

What is the order of operations? In the United States we use an acronym called PEMDAS which stands for:
	Parentheses
	Exponents
	Multiplication
	Division
	Addition
	Subtraction.

That's the order Python follows as well. The mistake people make with PEMDAS is to think this is a strict order, as in "Do P, then E, then M, then D, then A, then S."
The actual order is you do the multiplication and division (M&D) in one step, from left to right, then you do the addition and subtraction in one step from left to right.
So, you could rewrite PEMDAS as PE(M&D)(A&S)
